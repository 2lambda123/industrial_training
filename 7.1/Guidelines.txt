Cmake:
While catkin has headings in the cmake file, Ament/Colcon does not. Additionally, the Cmake version is upped from C++ 11 in melodic to C++ 14 in Dashing.

Additionally, the catkin package has been conveniently replaced with the rclcpp and ament packages. 'Default messages' interfaces also require the builtin interfaces and rosidl defalut genrators

find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(builtin_interfaces REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

messages are linked using  rosidl generate interfaces, like so:

rosidl_generate_interfaces(myworkcell_core
  "srv/LocalizePart.srv"
  DEPENDENCIES geometry_msgs
)
