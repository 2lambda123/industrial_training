# ROS1 to ROS2 porting

Our goal for this exercise is to have you fully port a small ROS1 application into ROS2. We'll be using the basic training material from sessions 1 and 2 as the initial ROS1 application.

## Overview of steps

- Create a new ROS2 workspace
- Clone and build ROS2 source dependency
- Create new empty ROS2 packages
- Copy code from ROS1 packages
- Build custom ROS2 messages/services
- Port C++ code
- Port launch file
- Run test
