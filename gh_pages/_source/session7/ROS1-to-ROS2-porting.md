# ROS1 to ROS2 porting

Our goal for this exercise is to have you fully port a small ROS1 application into ROS2. We'll be using the basic training material from sessions 1 and 2 as the initial ROS1 application.
 
 1. Setup the necessary files.
 
 2. Copy the exercise 2.3 folder and rename it 7.1

 3. Inside the src folder, open the myworkcell_core package. 

 4. Open and start porting over the CMakeLists.txt file.

 5. Open and start porting over the package.xml file.
 
 6. Inside the src folder, open myworkcell_node.cpp to start porting it over.

 7. Open and start porting over the vision_node.cpp file.
